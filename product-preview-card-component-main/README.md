### What I learned

I think this was my most challenging one yet because I was introduce to a new concept that I was not aware of before hand that is creating a responsive design that works with both PC and Mobile screens. I took a mobile first approach for this project and getting things to scale just right was new to me so it took me some time to get the hang of it but I have definitely improved by a lot and now have a better understanding of creating web pages that function on different screen sizes.
