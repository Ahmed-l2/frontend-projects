### What I learned

This one was actually a bit time consuming because there were small details that needed to be focused on. I was totally unfamiliar with how I can manage to get the page to display properly on mobile screens and this was the first time I've had to deal with this and I can say that I'm very proud of the outcome and I've learned alot about sizing elements and making sure they function properly with on different screen sizes.
